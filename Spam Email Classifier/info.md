# Project: Spam Email Classifier

* Define a Well-posed Learning Problem (T-P-E) 

Task (T): Classify emails as spam or not spam.
Performance (P): % of emails correctly classified.
Experience (E): A dataset of emails with labels spam/not spam.

* Design a Learning System

Step 1: Training Experience (E) → Dataset of emails.
Step 2: Target Function (T) → f(email) → {spam, not spam}.
Step 3: Representation → Probability model (Naive Bayes).
Step 4: Approximation Algorithm → Learn from word frequencies.
Step 5: Final Design → A model that predicts new unseen emails.
